# ARGENTBANK

![ArgentBank logo](public/readMe/logo.png)

_**ARGENTBANK**_ is a fresh new bank trying to break into the industry and wants to implement her app. In that way, two phases have been set up :

- **Phase 1 : User authentication** 
  
    The goal here was to transform a static HTML and CSS mock up in a React responsive application. For this purpose, it was requested to use react as state manager and respect a number of [issues](https://github.com/Roy-Framery-s-Openclassrooms-projects/royframery_13_24032022/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) to achieve this.

- **Phase 2 : transactions** 
    We are here in a conception phase of a new feature which can allow to users to view all their transactions for the current month, the details of a transaction in another view and to add, modify or delete information about a transaction. 

    It's a question here of documenting the implementation of these functionalities on the API side by using the Swagger syntax.

## Prerequisites 🚨
